# Whiskey Thief Client

Whiskey Thief is a single page application designed to allow users to store, view, and update information about their favorite whiskeys. A "whiskey thief" is a tool that master distillers use to extract small portions of whiskey from aging barrels for sampling. This application serves as a whiskey thief of sorts, allowing users to "sample" information about whiskeys they've tried. This application works with a backend API - see deployed site link under "Important Links".

I came up with this idea after spending the last year collecting over 50 bottles of whiskey with my husband. We are somewhat obsessed.

## Planning Story

I began the planning process by creating a wireframe for each portion of the app: sign in and create account, a page where the user could update their password, add a whiskey to their shelf, update a whiskey, see all whiskeys, delete a whiskey and sign out. 

### User Stories

-As a user, I need to be able to sign in, create an account, sign out, and change my password.
-As a user, I need to be able to add new whiskeys to my whiskey shelf.
-As a user, I need to be able to update information about my whiskeys, including adding comments specific to each whiskey.
-As a user, I need to be able to see a list of all whiskeys that I've tried.
-As a user, I need to be able to delete whiskeys from my account.
